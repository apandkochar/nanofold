# nanoFold: A Protein Folding Slowrun

nanoFold is a data-efficiency competition for protein structure prediction. It is inspired by the nanoGPT slowrun: everyone trains under a fixed budget, and the leaderboard rewards models that learn more structure from the same amount of data.

The core bet is simple: biological data is expensive. Text and image models often improve by consuming more data, but protein structure data is far more constrained, far harder to generate, and far more sensitive to leakage. If we want better biological foundation models, we need architectures and training methods that make stronger use of the data we already have.

This repo turns that idea into a benchmark. Participants get the same official train set, the same sample budget, and the same hidden evaluation path. Progress should come from better biological priors, better inductive biases, better objectives, better curricula, and better optimization under scarcity.

## What Counts As Progress

nanoFold is not meant to be a pretrained-weight contest, a web-retrieval contest, or a race to find near-duplicate templates. The official tracks are deliberately strict:

- fixed official data and manifests
- no external structures, pretrained weights, external MSA retrieval, or network access
- no template features in the official tracks
- hidden ranking by area under the learning curve for fixed-budget tracks
- atom14-aware scoring so methods are rewarded for more than Cα traces

The intended question is: **given the same limited training set, who learns useful protein geometry fastest and best?**

## How The Slowrun Works

The `limited` and `research_large` tracks train for fixed sample budgets. Their hidden leaderboards evaluate multiple checkpoints and rank by `foldscore_auc_hidden`: trapezoidal area under hidden FoldScore versus cumulative samples seen.

That makes early learning matter. A model that gets useful structure after 2,000 samples should beat a model that only wakes up at the end, even if their final scores are close. This is the pressure that should surface architectures with better biological priors.

FoldScore is a CASP15-inspired raw score over the CASP metrics that can be
computed reproducibly from the official atom14 output contract and official
residue identities:

```text
FoldScore =
  0.25*GDT_HA-Ca
+ 0.09375*(lDDT-all-atom14 + CADaa-atom14 + SG-atom14 + SC-atom14)
+ 0.125*(MolProbity-clash-atom14 + BB-atom14 + DipDiff-atom14)
```

`GDT_HA-Ca` measures global C-alpha fold accuracy with threshold-specific GDT
superpositions. The remaining terms measure local all-atom agreement, contact
preservation, SphereGrinder local motifs, chi1/chi2 side-chain geometry,
atom-name-aware heavy-atom clashes, phi/psi/omega backbone geometry, and
three-residue C-alpha/O distance windows. The weights are the CASP15 formula
weights renormalized over the structure-derived components supported by
nanoFold. `ASE` requires submitted confidence estimates and `reLLG_lddt`
requires a crystallographic molecular-replacement scoring path, so they are not
part of the official rank score.

The final hidden FoldScore is the tie-breaker for fixed-budget tracks and the primary rank metric for `unlimited`. Public validation exists for debugging, not ranking.

## What This Repo Provides

- official track policy in `tracks/limited.yaml`
- minAlphaFold2-derived preprocessing for A3M/mmCIF alignment, atom14 labels, residue constants, and template plumbing
- sealed prediction/scoring entrypoints that keep hidden labels away from submission code
- a strict submission API with `build_model`, `build_optimizer`, and `run_batch`
- dataset fingerprints and manifest checks so official data changes are visible
- an optional Modal GPU runner with local-disk data staging for public-data training
- a pinned minAlphaFold2 tiny reference submission plus a template submission that pass the official atom14 contract

## Tracks At A Glance

Source of truth: `tracks/*.yaml`. All tracks use the same official public train set, public validation set, sealed hidden validation set, CASP15-inspired FoldScore, and no-template policy. They differ in how much training budget is allowed and what scientific question the leaderboard is meant to answer.

| Track | Purpose | Fixed training budget | Rank metric | Use this when | Submit with |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `limited` | Main accessible slowrun leaderboard | `240,000` samples (`30,000` steps x effective batch `8`) | `foldscore_auc_hidden` | you want the primary competition result under a small, reproducible budget | `--track limited` |
| `research_large` | Larger fixed-data research leaderboard | `960,000` samples (`120,000` steps x effective batch `8`) | `foldscore_auc_hidden` | you want to study whether an approach still wins with more optimization while using the same data | `--track research_large` |
| `unlimited` | Open-ended fixed-data research leaderboard | unrestricted steps and model size with effective batch `8` | `final_hidden_foldscore` | you want the best final hidden structure quality while keeping the hidden set sealed and the public data contract fixed | `--track unlimited` |

For all three tracks, set `track: <track_id>` in `submissions/<name>/config.yaml`, validate with `python scripts/validate_submission.py --submission submissions/<name> --track <track_id> --strict`, and open a submission PR naming the intended track. Submit separate configs or separate submission directories when one method targets multiple tracks. Maintainers create accepted leaderboard entries after sealed hidden evaluation; participant PRs should not edit leaderboard artifacts.

Leaderboard entries include a linked `Name` column pointing to the accepted
submission directory and a `Team` column for identity. Use a lab, company,
project team, or individual researcher name consistently across submissions. If
`--team` is omitted during a PR-triggered GitHub Actions run, nanoFold falls
back to the PR author's GitHub username. Manual maintainer automation can set
`NANOFOLD_PR_AUTHOR=<github-username>` for the same fallback.

The `limited` constants are:

| Item | Value |
|---|---:|
| Train chains | `10,000` |
| Public val chains | `1,000` |
| Hidden val chains | `1,000` |
| Seed | `0` |
| Crop size | `256` |
| MSA depth | `192` |
| Effective batch size | `8` |
| Max steps | `30,000` |
| Sample budget | `240,000` |
| Residue budget | `61,440,000` |
| Parameter cap | unrestricted |
| Tie-breaker | `final_hidden_foldscore` |

## Split Curation

Official splits treat proteins as grouped biological examples, not IID rows in a text file:

- candidates are filtered by length, resolution, monomer status, and strict sequence content
- candidates with non-standard amino-acid tokens are excluded from the official split
- MMseqs2, or a locked TSV produced with the same MMseqs2 settings, defines sequence-homology groups
- train, public val, and hidden val are cluster-disjoint and PDB-entry-disjoint
- representatives are chosen by structure quality before length, so duplicate groups do not over-contribute low-quality chains
- structure metadata is required before splitting; the official allocation is stratified by secondary-structure class, broad domain architecture, length bin, and resolution bin
- metadata sources include pinned CATH, SCOPe, ECOD, and RCSB-style structural classifications when those records cover a chain
- required OpenFold feature-asset availability is enforced before split generation
- the lock records source hashes, filtering counts, clustering mode, grouping policy, stratification fields, split quality metrics, and per-split alpha/beta/mixed distributions

The metadata builder projects broad secondary-structure fractions from domain architecture classes so every eligible chain has a deterministic split signal before any label mmCIFs are downloaded. All metadata signals are used only for split balancing and audit reports, never for scoring.

## Data Format

Official preprocessing writes split artifacts per chain:
- features: `data/processed_features/<encoded_chain_id>.npz`
- labels: `data/processed_labels/<encoded_chain_id>.npz`

`<encoded_chain_id>` is nanoFold's filesystem-safe chain stem. It preserves
case-sensitive PDB chain IDs on every supported filesystem.

Required feature keys:
- `aatype`, `msa`, `deletions`
- `residue_index` — `(L,)` int32, contiguous 0..L-1 and available during sealed inference
- `between_segment_residues` — `(L,)` int32, zero for single-chain examples
- `template_aatype`, `template_ca_coords`, `template_ca_mask`

Required label keys:
- `ca_coords`, `ca_mask`
- `atom14_positions` — `(L, 14, 3)` float32, full atom14 layout
- `atom14_mask` — `(L, 14)` bool, True where coordinate was present in mmCIF

Additional label metadata:
- `residue_index` — `(L,)` int32, duplicated for convenience when present
- `resolution` — `()` float32, Å (0.0 if unknown)

Preprocessing run metadata is captured in `<processed_features_dir>/preprocess_meta.json`. Its SHA256 is folded into the dataset fingerprint, so changes to preprocessing flags, projection thresholds, dependency metadata, or source revision are visible to the verifier.

Official scoring requires atom14 labels, and submissions must return `pred_atom14` shaped `(B, L, 14, 3)`. The runtime derives the Cα view from atom14 slot 1 for diagnostics.

Official maintainer refreshes must sanitize evolutionary inputs after the
train/public-val/hidden-val trio is known. `scripts/full_official_data_refresh.sh`
downloads raw public and hidden OpenProteinSet assets, builds a private
SHA256-only held-out-target MSA row filter from train + public validation +
hidden validation source MSAs against the public and hidden validation target
sets, and passes that filter to public and hidden preprocessing. This removes
non-query MSA rows homologous to held-out target sequences before the MSA depth
cap is applied, preserves each chain's query row, and records the filter hash in
both feature NPZs and preprocessing metadata.

Ad hoc maintainer/research preprocessing can still pass an explicit
`--msa-row-filter` JSON from `scripts/build_msa_row_filter.py`. Filters built
against hidden validation targets are private artifacts and must not be
published.

Maintainers can audit MSA availability, MSA-depth balance, exact processed-row
overlap, optional MMseqs homology, and raw A3M hit-identifier overlap with
`scripts/audit_msa_split.py`. Hidden-audit reports should keep the default
identifier-free output unless private artifacts stay sealed.
For private checks over current feature NPZs, repeat
`--source-processed-features-dir` when building the row filter so public and
private hidden feature roots are scanned together.
When raw A3Ms are incomplete locally, maintainers can apply the resulting filter
to existing feature NPZs with `scripts/filter_processed_msa_features.py`. This
is a processed-feature fallback for audits or reruns; full official
regeneration should still use `scripts/preprocess.py --msa-row-filter` so
filtering happens before the MSA depth cap.
If a post-filter MMseqs audit finds residual hits, use
`scripts/extend_msa_row_filter_from_audit.py` to add those anonymous source-row
hashes to a closure filter, then reapply and audit again.
Use `scripts/write_msa_row_filter_source_lock.py` to summarize the final filter
and processed-feature filtering passes into a compact audit/source-lock record
without raw sequences, per-chain audit rows, hidden chain IDs, or excluded hash
lists.

The official tracks disable templates by preprocessing with `T=0`; template-enabled tracks require explicit leakage filters.

Config schema uses:
- `data.processed_features_dir`
- `data.processed_labels_dir`

## Official Policy

In `--official` mode, the runner applies override + validate:
- immutable track constants are forced into config at startup
- then policy validation and manifest hash checks run
- trainable parameter count is reported; no public track enforces a hard parameter cap

This is implemented in:
- `nanofold/competition_policy.py`
- `train.py`
- `eval.py`
- `scripts/validate_submission.py`

## Quickstart

The fastest participant path is in [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md). It covers:

- environment setup
- official public data download and preprocessing
- first minAlphaFold2 tiny reference training run
- public validation prediction and scoring
- creating and validating a new submission
- submitting a leaderboard pull request

## Maintainer Hidden Assets

The committed public manifests are the participant data contract. Maintainers generate hidden validation privately against that fixed public split:

```bash
mkdir -p .nanofold_private/secrets
python -c "import pathlib,secrets; pathlib.Path('.nanofold_private/secrets/hidden_split_salt.txt').write_text(secrets.token_urlsafe(48) + '\n')"
chmod 600 .nanofold_private/secrets/hidden_split_salt.txt

python scripts/build_hidden_manifest.py \
  --hidden-split-salt-file .nanofold_private/secrets/hidden_split_salt.txt

python scripts/verify_hidden_manifest.py
```

This requires MMseqs2 on `PATH`, the locked OpenProteinSet chain cache, and `data/manifests/structure_metadata.json`. The salt file, hidden manifest, hidden labels, hidden fingerprints, and hidden locks stay under `.nanofold_private/` and must never be committed.

If private hidden preprocessing finds unprocessable structures, record them only in `.nanofold_private/manifests/hidden_processability_exclusions.txt`, rerun `scripts/build_hidden_manifest.py`, and rerun `scripts/verify_hidden_manifest.py`.

For a full official data-contract refresh, prefer the single end-to-end command
below; it regenerates the public manifests, hidden manifest, held-out MSA row
filter, sanitized public/hidden NPZs, and fingerprints together:

```bash
bash scripts/full_official_data_refresh.sh --rewrite-lock
```

For manual hidden-asset maintenance against an already-fixed public split, build
or reuse the same held-out MSA row filter before preprocessing hidden features.
The filter must be built from the train, public validation, and hidden
validation source MSAs against the public and hidden validation target sets, so
train MSAs cannot carry held-out validation homolog rows. Then build the hidden
NPZs and pin their fingerprint:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_data.py \
  --data-root data/openproteinset \
  --manifest .nanofold_private/manifests/hidden_val.txt \
  --duplicate-chains-file data/openproteinset/pdb_data/duplicate_pdb_chains.txt \
  --strict-downloads \
  --no-template-hits \
  --download-mmcif-subset

python scripts/preprocess.py \
  --raw-root data/openproteinset \
  --mmcif-root data/openproteinset/pdb_data/mmcif_files \
  --processed-features-dir .nanofold_private/hidden_processed_features \
  --processed-labels-dir .nanofold_private/hidden_processed_labels \
  --manifest .nanofold_private/manifests/hidden_val.txt \
  --msa-row-filter .nanofold_private/msa_row_filters/official_heldout_target_homology_filter.json \
  --disable-templates

python scripts/build_fingerprint.py \
  --processed-features-dir .nanofold_private/hidden_processed_features \
  --processed-labels-dir .nanofold_private/hidden_processed_labels \
  --manifest hidden_val=.nanofold_private/manifests/hidden_val.txt \
  --track limited \
  --source-lock leaderboard/official_manifest_source.lock.json \
  --output .nanofold_private/leaderboard/official_hidden_fingerprint.json

python scripts/pin_hidden_assets.py \
  --hidden-manifest .nanofold_private/manifests/hidden_val.txt \
  --hidden-features-dir .nanofold_private/hidden_processed_features \
  --hidden-labels-dir .nanofold_private/hidden_processed_labels \
  --hidden-fingerprint .nanofold_private/leaderboard/official_hidden_fingerprint.json \
  --track-id limited \
  --lock-file .nanofold_private/leaderboard/private_hidden_assets.lock.json
```

Public outputs land in stable, commit-safe paths:
- `data/manifests/train.txt`
- `data/manifests/val.txt`
- `data/manifests/all.txt`
- `leaderboard/official_dataset_fingerprint.json`
- `leaderboard/official_manifest_source.lock.json`

Maintainer-only outputs land under `.nanofold_private/`:
- `.nanofold_private/manifests/hidden_val.txt`
- `.nanofold_private/manifests/split_quality_report.json`
- `.nanofold_private/manifests/hidden_processability_exclusions.txt`
- `.nanofold_private/hidden_processed_features/`
- `.nanofold_private/hidden_processed_labels/`
- `.nanofold_private/leaderboard/official_hidden_fingerprint.json`
- `.nanofold_private/leaderboard/private_hidden_assets.lock.json`
- `.nanofold_private/leaderboard/private_hidden_manifest_source.lock.json`
- `.nanofold_private/leaderboard/official_data_source.lock.json`

The metadata builder also writes `data/manifests/structure_candidates.txt` as an ignored local audit artifact. Commit only public manifests, the public dataset fingerprint, and sanitized public lock metadata.

Full public-data rebuilds are maintainer operations for changing the official public data contract. By default the refresh builds `.nanofold_private/msa_row_filters/official_heldout_target_homology_filter.json` and preprocesses public + hidden features with it; do not use `--skip-msa-row-filter-build` for an official trio refresh.

```bash
bash scripts/full_official_data_refresh.sh --rewrite-lock
```

## Hidden Leaderboard Runs

Hidden leaderboard runs are maintainer-only. The prediction stage sees submission code plus hidden features. The scoring stage sees saved predictions plus hidden labels. Submission code is never imported during hidden scoring.

Hidden mode uses `.nanofold_private/` by default. Override these only when hidden assets live elsewhere:
- `NANOFOLD_HIDDEN_MANIFEST`
- `NANOFOLD_HIDDEN_FEATURES_DIR`
- `NANOFOLD_HIDDEN_LABELS_DIR`
- `NANOFOLD_HIDDEN_FINGERPRINT`
- `NANOFOLD_HIDDEN_LOCK_FILE`

Canonical runner entrypoint:

```bash
python scripts/run_official.py \
  --submission submissions/<name> \
  --track <track_id> \
  --team "<team or individual name>" \
  --update-leaderboard
```

Hidden leaderboard runs require a sealed no-network runtime. The supported path is:

```bash
bash scripts/run_official_docker.sh \
  --submission submissions/<name> \
  --track <track_id> \
  --team "<team or individual name>" \
  --update-leaderboard
```

The Docker image build context intentionally excludes generated datasets, private hidden assets, local Python environments, checkpoints, and run outputs. Hidden data is mounted read-only during the prediction and scoring stages.

Maintainers can run the same two-stage hidden evaluation on Modal when the checkpoint already lives in the `nanofold-runs` Modal volume:

```bash
modal run scripts/modal_official.py \
  --upload-public-data \
  --upload-hidden-assets \
  --upload-only
```

```bash
modal run scripts/modal_official.py \
  --submission submissions/<name> \
  --config submissions/<name>/config.yaml \
  --track <track_id> \
  --team "<team or individual name>" \
  --update-leaderboard
```

For long Modal runs, launch the prediction and scoring stages as detached calls, then download the durable result artifact and update the local leaderboard:

```bash
modal run --detach scripts/modal_official.py \
  --submission submissions/<name> \
  --config submissions/<name>/config.yaml \
  --track <track_id> \
  --team "<team or individual name>" \
  --skip-score \
  --background-predict
```

```bash
modal run --detach scripts/modal_official.py \
  --submission submissions/<name> \
  --config submissions/<name>/config.yaml \
  --track <track_id> \
  --team "<team or individual name>" \
  --skip-predict \
  --background-score
```

```bash
modal volume get nanofold-runs <run_name>/modal_official_result.json runs/<run_name>/modal_official_result.json
python scripts/add_leaderboard_entry.py \
  --result runs/<run_name>/modal_official_result.json \
  --leaderboard leaderboard/leaderboard.json \
  --readme README.md \
  --description "<leaderboard description>" \
  --team "<team or individual name>"
```

Use the upload command the first time a Modal environment is prepared, or whenever public/hidden assets change. Hidden Modal execution uses separate no-network prediction and scoring functions; hidden labels are not mounted during prediction. Both Modal stages request the configured GPU because atom14 structural scoring is pairwise-distance heavy.

Hidden lock metadata is maintainer-local and ignored by git. Populate/update it with `python scripts/pin_hidden_assets.py ...`.

## Manifest Reproducibility

Check committed official manifest hashes:

```bash
shasum -a 256 data/manifests/train.txt data/manifests/val.txt data/manifests/all.txt
```

Expected public manifest values for all tracks:
- `train.txt`: `d36d1f77ba43b7c4509a6e9dfd3f9414e1ce60f8364b24e0086c1734ba6aef6d`
- `val.txt`: `d4a0265bcd0a021e116c0c889f21e86bc24006460bcc42dec2f9a80b70c8812b`
- `all.txt`: `0d1b21a3536cd0c602be301993fcbacd8ecc5710a459c239f9808d164d0ee85d`

Maintainer-only manifest regeneration:

```bash
bash scripts/regenerate_official_manifests.sh --rewrite-lock
```

Sync public hashes/counts across pinned references (track + lock + docs):

```bash
python scripts/sync_official_manifest_hashes.py
```

## Submitter Self-Check

```bash
python scripts/validate_submission.py \
  --submission submissions/<your_name> \
  --track <track_id> \
  --strict

if git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -Eq '^data/manifests/(train|val|all)\.txt$'; then
  echo "ERROR: PR edits protected manifests. Ask maintainer for explicit approval label."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Self-check passed."
```

CI enforces the same PR guardrail:
- edits to `data/manifests/train.txt`, `data/manifests/val.txt`, or `data/manifests/all.txt` fail unless label `manifest-change-approved` is present.
